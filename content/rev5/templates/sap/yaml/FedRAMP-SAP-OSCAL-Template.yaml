      Link the SAP to the SSP.

      FedRAMP prefers the path for the SSP be relative to the location of this SAP file. Absolute links will likely not work when FedRAMP tools import the content.

      This may point to a back-matter resource using a URI fragment.

      If no OSCAL-based SSP exists, this must be a URI fragment pointing to a special back-matter resource. The resource must include the `no-oscal-ssp` conformity tag.

        The UUID assigned to the origional incorrect role in the SSP must be cited in the "updates-uuid" property.

        The SAP syntax duplicates the SSP user syntax.

        This local entry completely replaces the entry in the SSP.

        Tools should duplicate the entire assembly from the SSP to this location, then allow the assessor to add or change the details.

        This ensures the entry here is complete.

      # IMPORTANT: RESPONSE POINTS

      Within each FedRAMP baseline, FedRAMP has added "response-point" properties as a FedRAMP Extension.

      These are found in control statements (for CSPs to use in their SSP) and in control objectives (for assessors to use in their SAP and SAR).

      SAP tools should scan the appropriate baseline (as identified by the SSP's `import-profile` statement), find the response points associated with control objectives (ignoring response points associated with statements), and insert one `include-objective` field for each identified response point.

      For this task, tools should either scan the resolved profile catalog version of each baseline, or resolve the profile against its catalog before processing.

      XPath for all control objectie response points in a resolved profile catalog: `//control/part[@name='objective']//prop[@name='response-point'][@ns='https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal']/../@id`

      XPath for AC-2(f) control objective response points in a resolved profile catalog: `//*/part[@name='objective' and contains(@id, 'ac-2.f')]/prop[@name='response-point'][@ns='https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal']/../@id`

          This plan is for an annual assessment of \[CSO Name\], a \[One: High/Moderate/ Low\] baseline system. After the initial security assessment, FedRAMP requires that the system is assessed annually thereafter (12 months from an agency ATO / JAB P-ATO date). While the entire set of security controls is assessed during the initial assessment, a subset is assessed during the annual assessment. The control selection is in accordance with the criteria outlined in the [FedRAMP Annual Assessment Guidance](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Annual_Assessment_Guidance.pdf) and includes:

          - Core controls (required annually)
          - CSP-selected controls required to address system changes that have been implemented and/or changed by a CSP since their last assessment (this excludes those controls or portions of controls previously assessed under a significant change within the same annual period)
          - Validation of Plan of Action \& Milestones (POA\&Ms) closed since the last assessment
          - Validation of POA\&Ms identified as vendor dependencies (VDs) or deviation requests (DRs)
          - CSP-selected controls identified as "Not Applicable" (N/A) to validate they are, in fact, not applicable
          - Controls that have not been assessed, at least once in a three year period, to ensure controls are meeting periodicity requirements

        FedRAMP is formulating guidelines for handling digital/electronic signatures in OSCAL, and welcome feedback on solutions.

        For now, FedRAMP recommends one of the following:

        - Render the OSCAL SAP signature page as a PDF that is digitally signed and attached.
        - Render the OSCAL SAP signature page as a printed page that is physically signed, scanned, and attached.

        If your organization prefers another approach, please seek prior approval from the FedRAMP PMO.

Additional attack vectors are outlined in the table below and will be recorded in the \[CSO Name\] Penetration Test Report. Deviations between this list and the Penetration Test Report will be recorded and explained in the SAR table "Deviations from the SAP".

        Techniques to test each system may vary depending on the service offering (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and Hybrid). Due to system commonalities, the mandatory attack vectors apply to all systems, as indicated by the "x" in the "Include" column. Ensure that all the appropriate threat models and attack models are marked a "x", as well. The \[CSO Name\] Penetration Test Report will include the testing of all the parameters, as indicated in this table.
