        FedRAMP is formulating guidelines for handling digital/electronic signatures in OSCAL, and welcome feedback on solutions.

        For now, FedRAMP recommends one of the following:

        - Render the OSCAL SAR content as a PDF that is digitally signed and attached.
        - Render the OSCAL SAR content as printed pages that are physically signed, scanned, and attached.

        If your organization prefers another approach, please seek prior approval from the FedRAMP PMO.
